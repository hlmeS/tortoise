A MQTT Client application that keep connections to one or more MQTT
brokers, handles subscriptions, and expose a publisher for publishing
messages to the broker.

This is work in progress. The documentation sure needs improvements,
and while the user interface is stabilizing there might be some
changes in the future. Amongst other things the client supports:

  - Keeping a connection to a MQTT server (version 3.1.1 for now)
  - Publishing and subscribing to topics of QoS 0, 1, and 2
  - Connecting via TCP and SSL (experimental)
  - The fundamentals are there, but some of the API's might change in
    the near future

Most of the public facing interface should be in the `Tortoise`
module. See the GitHub issues for work in progress "known issues in
the design", "what needs to be done", and so forth; feel free to open
your own issues if something is confusing or broken.

I would love to get some feedback and help building this thing.


## Example

Just to get people started:

``` elixir
# connect to the server and subscribe to foo/bar with QoS 0
Tortoise.Supervisor.start_child(
    client_id: "my_client_id",
    handler: {Tortoise.Handler.Logger, []},
    server: {Tortoise.Transport.Tcp, host: 'localhost', port: 1883},
    subscriptions: [{"foo/bar", 0}])

# publish a message on the broker
Tortoise.publish("my_client_id", "foo/bar", "Hello from the World of Tomorrow !", qos: 0)
```

To connect to a MQTT server using SSL the `Tortoise.Transport.SSL`
transport can be used like this:

``` elixir
Tortoise.Supervisor.start_child(
    client_id: "smart-spoon",
    handler: {Tortoise.Handler.Logger, []},
    server: {Tortoise.Transport.SSL, host: host, port: port, key: key, cert: cert},
    subscriptions: [{"foo/bar", 0}])
```

Look at the `connection_test.exs`-file for an example.

## Installation

Tortoise is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the
package can be installed by adding `tortoise` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tortoise, "~> 0.3.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tortoise](https://hexdocs.pm/tortoise).

## Building documentation

To build the documentation run the following command in a terminal emulator:

``` shell
MIX_ENV=docs mix docs
```

This will build the documentation in place them in the *doc*-folder in
the root of the project. These docs will also find their way to the
Hexdocs website when they project has been published on Hex in the
future.
